/// <summary>
/// This script contains a component for applying linear per-vertex deformation
/// to points in a mesh. It works with both static and skinned meshes. The data
/// are sparse, so it only operates on points that actually produce
/// deformation.
/// 
/// It works by applying target deformation to a proxy mesh, seamlessBaseMesh,
/// and then mapping the results of this deformation back to _outMesh, the mesh
/// being rendered. Because the proxy mesh is presumed to have no seams from
/// uv, normal, or submesh separations, it allows for fast recalculation of
/// smooth normals using Mesh.RecalculateNormals(), and is consequently faster
/// since it has fewer points than _outMesh.
/// 
/// This component is intended to be set up entirely by editor scripts since it
/// requires proper mapping of sparse target information. For an example of
/// data coming from Maya, see ImportBlendShapeData.cs.
/// 
/// If you are planning to control this script externally, set the desired
/// weight values for all of the targets and then call Compute().
/// 
/// For best perormance, the component does not automatically recalculate
/// bounds for the mesh. If you know you will have dramatic changes, it is
/// advised that you call Compute() from another script and then call
/// RecalculateBounds().
/// 
/// The component assumes that the point count, triangle list, and winding
/// order for the mesh being rendered do not change at run-time.
/// 
/// Computing smooth normals relies on Mesh.RecalculateNormals(), which does
/// not produce identical results to 180-degree smoothing in the asset importer
/// or in a modeling application. Consequently, you may see some minor visual
/// artifacts, especially if using normal maps that were generated without this
/// assumption.
/// 
/// Computing smooth normals works in the space of the proxy seamlessBaseMesh.
/// As such, it presumes that any seams existing on the proxy are intentional.
/// 
/// Computing smooth normals will not preserve manually-specified normals.
/// 
/// The component cannot be meaningfully configured without editor scripts.
/// 
/// No support yet for in-between targets.
